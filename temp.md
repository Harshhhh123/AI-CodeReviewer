### âœ… Strengths
- The code defines a function, which is a good practice for organizing code.

### âš¡ Areas for Improvement
- The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b`, but these variables are not defined within the function or passed as
arguments. This will lead to an error when the function is executed.
- The function lacks input validation or error handling.
- There is no JSDoc documentation to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

### ðŸ›  Suggested Improvements
- Define the variables `a` and `b` within the function scope or pass them as arguments.
- Add JSDoc documentation.

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
throw new TypeError('Both arguments must be numbers.');
}
return a + b;
}
```

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
- The original code lacked necessary variable definitions and documentation. Including argument validation is a good
practice for robustness.
